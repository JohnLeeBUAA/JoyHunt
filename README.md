## Project Info
This is an HTML based demo for a mobile game app "JoyHunt". The game consists of a series of JoyHunts where players are encouraged to join social activities with matched partners. This game builds a presure-free environment for students with social anxieties to overcome their problem, make friends and connect with other people.
